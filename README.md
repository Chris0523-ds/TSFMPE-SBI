# TSFMPE-SBI
This repository is for Truncated Sequential Flow Matching Posterior Estimation(TSFMPE), which combines the flow matching methodology with truncated proposal. This method can be seen as the sequential variant of FMPE(Flow Matching Posterior Estimation).

This idea is based on two papers in Simulation-Based Inference(SBI) community:
Flow Matching for Scalable Simulation-Based Inference: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17161
Truncated proposals for scalable and hassle-free simulation-based inference https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04815
This idea is previously applied in Truncated Sequential Neural Posterior Score Estimation(TSNPSE), which is the integration of diffusion model and truncated approach.
